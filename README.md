**FPGA-CV (FPGA Computer Vision)** is a framework designed for FPGA enthusiasts to facilitate the development of Computer Vision applications.

FPGA development is inherently complex, and integrating Computer Vision adds another layer of complexity. This project aims to lower the entry barrier by providing a comprehensive framework for FPGA Computer Vision development, starting from self-checking RTL simulation to the FPGA runtime environment.

This project supports FPGA enthusiasts, students, researchers, and engineers working on FPGA-based image or video processing applications. Originating from a PhD project focused on real-time pedestrian detection from infrared video streams, it provides a platform for anyone interested in experimenting with FPGA and image processing.

The motivation is to become the go-to framework for FPGA Computer Vision applications. 

It is based on permissive license allowing nearly unrestricted freedom as long as the original license and copyright notice are included. I do this is my spare time to get more people involved in FPGA development. I would appreciate if you could spread the word, share with others and reference it in your projects, during workshops and papers: _cambert. (2024, June 15). *FPGA-CV*.
